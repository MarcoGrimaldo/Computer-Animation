Main idea:

It will be an historic context, it's the history about "The sad night", when Hernan Cortes had to run away from Tenochtitlan.
The Mexicas won that battle against the Spain Army. The reason for this animation is because we as mexicans have to be proud about the mexicas culture and why is called "Sad night"? Instead they could be named "The glorius night".
